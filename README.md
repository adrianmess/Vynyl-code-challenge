This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Write some code to flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of strings into a flat array of strings (e.g., [['one','two',['three']],'four'] -> ['one','two','three','four'].

* Submit your code as if it were intended for production.

* Details matter - please include tests and make your code simple and idiomatic.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
